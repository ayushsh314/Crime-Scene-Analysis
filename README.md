# Crime-Scene-Analysis

The news headline generation of crime is a
tedious task in journalism reporting that requires analysis and
creative skills. Often, human observation and reasoning is
subject to error or fallacies, and it is a time-consuming task.
Hence an automated headline generation mechanism would
greatly benefit media teams. The traditional approach of news
headline generation primarily relies on textual data and not on
images, which may not always provide a comprehensive
understanding of the story. Generating headlines from images
requires a deep understanding of the visual content and the
ability to extract relevant information. Thus, there is a need for
a system that can leverage the power of image detection to
automatically generate news headlines that accurately reflect
the visual content of an image. This research, which has been
proposed by this paper could potentially revolutionize the way
news headlines and articles are generated, as it would allow for
a more nuanced and accurate representation of the crime scene.
